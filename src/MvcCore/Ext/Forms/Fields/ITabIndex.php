	 * be indexed from value `1` and moved to specific higher value by place, where form is 
	 * currently rendered by form instance method `$form->SetBaseTabIndex()` to move tabindex 
	 * for each field into final values. Tabindex can takes several values:
	 * - a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but should not be 
	 *   reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;
	 * - 0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential 
	 *   keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;
	 * - a positive value means that the element should be focusable and reachable via 
	 *   sequential keyboard navigation; the order in which the elements are focused is 
	 *   the increasing value of the tabindex. If several elements share the same tabindex, 
	 *   their relative order follows their relative positions in the document.
